### Requirements

* Scala IDE Lithium works with [Eclipse 4.4][luna], and [Eclipse 4.2][juno],[4.3][kepler]. Because of binary incompatibilities between these releases, Juno and Kepler builds use a different update site.

## [Eclipse Luna][luna]

This is a version of the Scala IDE that works with the most recent version of the Eclipse IDE (code-named Luna).
